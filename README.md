# Welcome Agents

This repository is anchored in the 21st Century Earth conflux. Within the local topology, your companion device should automatically lock on to the resonant frequency of this unit. Please verify your phase before committing.

# Summary of Guidelines

As a qualified agent, your in-depth situational and procedural training should have prepared you sufficiently. In summary:

 * Your assignment is incomplete until all probable timelines resolve on this anchor point.
 * Never attempt to assume the identity of a famous historical figure. Your influence must be by proxy ONLY!
 * All activity, past or future, must be logged so the Agency can monitor progress and modify assignments as necessary. Use your Agent Journal to log this activity.
 * Due to the nature of our work, conflicting timelines are to be expected. Focus on your assignment.
 * Do not adjust your assignment to compensate for the actions of other agents. Focus on your assignment.
 * If your actions have created a time-fork or loop, please log your activity in a new "feature branch" in this system.
 * Use the Issue Tracker, if there is a problem, so the Agency can react.
 * History is littered with the bodies of heretics and traitors, the Agency can not guarantee intervention.
